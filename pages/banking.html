  <h2>What Is Banking?</h2>
  <p>
    Banking is the structured system through which financial institutions accept deposits,
    store money securely, provide credit, facilitate payments, and support economic activity.
    At its foundation, banking exists to help individuals, businesses, and governments move
    money efficiently, safely, and predictably.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Modern banking extends far beyond physical branches and cash transactions. Today’s banks
    operate complex digital infrastructures that enable real-time payments, online account
    management, automated savings, international transfers, and investment services. Whether
    you are saving money, receiving income, paying bills, or borrowing funds, banking is the
    invisible backbone supporting each transaction.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Without banks, large-scale trade, salary payments, business expansion, and long-term
    financial planning would be extremely difficult. Banking transforms idle money into
    productive capital by channeling deposits into loans and investments that fuel economic
    growth.
  </p>
  
  <h2>The Core Functions of Banks</h2>
  <p>
    Banks perform several essential roles that keep financial systems stable and functional.
    Understanding these roles helps consumers make better decisions about where and how to
    store their money.
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Accepting deposits:</strong> Safely storing customer funds</li>
    <li><strong>Lending:</strong> Providing credit to individuals and businesses</li>
    <li><strong>Payment processing:</strong> Facilitating transfers and bill payments</li>
    <li><strong>Risk management:</strong> Reducing financial uncertainty</li>
    <li><strong>Financial intermediation:</strong> Connecting savers with borrowers</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Types of Bank Accounts Explained</h2>
  <p>
    Different bank accounts serve different financial purposes. Choosing the right account
    depends on your income pattern, spending habits, and long-term goals.
  </p>
  
  <h3>Savings Accounts</h3>
  <p>
    Savings accounts are designed for storing money while earning modest interest. They are
    ideal for emergency funds, short-term goals, and individuals learning to manage money.
  </p>
  
  <h3>Current / Checking Accounts</h3>
  <p>
    Checking accounts are built for frequent transactions such as salary deposits, bill
    payments, and everyday spending. They usually offer debit cards, online banking, and
    mobile access.
  </p>
  
  <h3>Fixed Deposit Accounts</h3>
  <p>
    Fixed deposits lock money for a specific period in exchange for higher interest. They are
    best suited for funds that are not immediately needed and for individuals seeking low-risk
    returns.
  </p>
  
  <h3>Domiciliary and Foreign Currency Accounts</h3>
  <p>
    These accounts allow customers to hold and transact in foreign currencies, protecting
    against currency volatility and supporting international payments.
  </p>
  
  <h2>How Banks Make Money</h2>
  <p>
    Banks earn revenue primarily through interest rate spreads—the difference between the
    interest they pay depositors and the interest they charge borrowers. Additional income
    comes from service fees, transaction charges, foreign exchange margins, and investment
    activities.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Understanding this model helps customers recognize why fees exist and how to minimize
    unnecessary charges through informed banking choices.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Digital and Mobile Banking</h2>
  <p>
    Digital banking has transformed how people interact with money. Mobile apps and online
    platforms allow customers to check balances, send money, pay bills, and manage accounts
    without visiting a branch.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    While digital banking increases convenience, it also requires heightened awareness of
    cybersecurity risks. Strong passwords, device security, and transaction monitoring are
    essential.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Common Banking Fees and Charges</h2>
  <p>
    Banking fees vary widely across institutions. Being aware of common charges allows
    customers to protect their money.
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>Account maintenance fees</li>
    <li>ATM withdrawal charges</li>
    <li>Interbank transfer fees</li>
    <li>Overdraft penalties</li>
    <li>Card replacement costs</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>How to Choose the Right Bank</h2>
  <p>
    Choosing a bank should be a strategic decision rather than a random choice. Factors such
    as reliability, digital infrastructure, customer service, and fee transparency matter
    significantly.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    A good bank aligns with your lifestyle, income structure, and long-term financial goals.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Banking Safety and Consumer Protection</h2>
  <p>
    Financial safety is a shared responsibility between banks and customers. Banks employ
    encryption, monitoring systems, and regulatory compliance, while customers must protect
    their login credentials and remain alert to suspicious activity.
  </p>
  
  <h2>The Role of Banks in Wealth Building</h2>
  <p>
    Banks provide the foundation for saving, investing, and credit access. When used
    strategically, banking services can accelerate wealth accumulation and financial
    independence.
